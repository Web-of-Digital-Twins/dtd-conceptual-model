- **[WoT Thing Description DTD implementation](https://github.com/Web-of-Digital-Twins/dtd-conceptual-model/blob/main/implementations/wot/wot-mappings.md)**: it is the first implementation of the Digital Twin Description. It uses the [Web of Things Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) provinding and integration point towards [Web of Things](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/).
